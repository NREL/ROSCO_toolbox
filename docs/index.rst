ROSCO toolbox documentation
===========================

DEPRECATED!
------------
As of version 2.4.0, the ROSCO toolbox has been combined with the ROSCO git repository here:
https://github.com/NREL/ROSCO

The updated documentation lives here:
https://rosco.readthedocs.io/

Please use the combined tool-set going forward. All functionalities of the ROSCO toolbox still preserved (and expanded!), just a slight code restructure was in order. Thank you for understanding, and we hope this does not cause any significant inconvenience.
