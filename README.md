# NREL's Reference OpenSource Controller (ROSCO) toolbox for wind turbine applications
This tool-set has been DEPRECIATED!

As of version 2.4.0, the ROSCO toolbox has been combined with the ROSCO git repository here:
[ROSCO](https://github.com/NREL/ROSCO) 

Please use the combined tool-set going forward. All functionalities of the ROSCO toolbox still preserved (and expanded!), just a slight code restructure was in order. Thank you for understanding, and we hope this does not cause any significant inconvenience.
